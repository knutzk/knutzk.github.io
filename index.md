Hi! I am an experimental particle physicist, and my goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the fundamental building blocks of the world. I work on the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which is the most powerful particle accelerator in the world. The LHC is located in CERN, Geneva, Switzerland.


I am currently researching the physics of the top quark, looking for long-lived exotic particles, and upgrading the ATLAS detector for the high-luminosity LHC, the next generation of accelerators. At the moment, I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Department of Physics](https://www.physics.harvard.edu/) at Harvard University, working with Professor Morii.


For more details on how I got here, please check out the [biography page](/bio/) or my [academic CV](/cv/).
