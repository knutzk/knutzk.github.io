Hi, I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the group of Professor Morii at the Harvard University [Department of Physics](https://www.physics.harvard.edu/), affiliated with the [Laboratory for Particle Physics and Cosmology (LPPC)](https://lppc.physics.harvard.edu/). I am an experimental particle physicist working on the **ATLAS Experiment**, which records particle collisions at the world’s most powerful particle accelerator, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The home of both the ATLAS Experiment and the LHC accelerator is **CERN**, the European Center for Nuclear Research, near Geneva in Switzerland – which is where I conduct my research.
